CRY ME A RIVER
A PENNY SAVED IS A PENNY EARNED
WHEN LIFE GIVES YOU LEMONS MAKE LEMONADE
AN UNEXAMINED LIFE IS NOT WORTH LIVING
A ROLLING STONE GATHERS NO MOSS
ALL GOOD THINGS MUST COME TO AN END
LOOK ON THE BRIGHT SIDE
THE DARKEST HOURS ARE JUST BEFORE DAWN
WHERE THERE'S A WILL THERE'S A WAY
